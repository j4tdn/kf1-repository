1. How array data structure works?
+ index-base
+ fixed-length

2. Can we add, remove an element in array?
+ no
+ add, remove --> create new instance of array.

3. Different between Comparator and Comparable

4. How Arrays.sort(..) and Arrays.sort(..., Comparator<T>) differentiate?

5. Logic

------ Restriction of Array -----------
+ fixed length
+ not support basic CRUD operations (e.g add, remove)
